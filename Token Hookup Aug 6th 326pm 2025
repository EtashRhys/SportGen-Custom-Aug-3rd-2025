✅ Yes — you **are using JWTs** correctly via FastAPI’s OAuth2 flow, with an `/auth-service` issuing **access tokens** and a `get_current_user()` dependency for protected routes. It's clean and scalable.

So now, to answer your question directly:

---

### 💡 **What’s Best for Your Current Setup?**

> **✅ Always pass the `accessToken` to protected endpoints (like `/videos/upload` and `/analysis`) from the frontend.**

You're building a secure multi-user app, and each video upload and analysis should be tied to a specific authenticated user. Since you’ve already got JWTs, your current architecture is perfect for:

* 👤 **Per-user data isolation**
* 🔐 **Secure access to protected resources**
* 🧠 **AI feedback tied to a user's specific video & pose data**

---

### 🔄 So Here's What to Do:

#### ✅ **Step 1 – Pass the JWT from the frontend**

In `upload.tsx`, before calling any API function:

```tsx
const accessToken = localStorage.getItem("accessToken") || "";
```

Then:

```tsx
const uploadRes = await uploadVideo(selectedFile, accessToken);
const analysisRes = await analyzeVideo(uploadedPath, accessToken);
```

---

#### ✅ **Step 2 – Update `uploadVideo()` in `api.ts` to require token**

Keep it like this:

```ts
export async function uploadVideo(file: File, accessToken: string): Promise<UploadResponse> {
  const formData = new FormData();
  formData.append("file", file);

  const res = await fetch(`${API_BASE}/videos/upload`, {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken}`,
    },
    body: formData,
  });

  if (!res.ok) {
    const errorText = await res.text();
    throw new Error(`Upload failed: ${errorText}`);
  }
  return res.json();
}
```

✅ This guarantees every upload is authenticated.

---

#### ✅ **Step 3 – Backend endpoints must use `Depends(get_current_user)`**

This ensures the token is validated before processing:

Example:

```py
from fastapi import Depends, UploadFile, File
from auth_app import get_current_user  # import from auth service

@app.post("/videos/upload")
async def upload_video(file: UploadFile = File(...), current_user=Depends(get_current_user)):
    # You now have `current_user["id"]` and `current_user["email"]`
    ...
```

Same thing for `/analysis`, if you want that protected too.

### ✅ Final Recap

| Frontend                                                   | Backend                                 |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Grab `accessToken` from localStorage                       | Use `Depends(get_current_user)`         |
| Pass it in `Authorization: Bearer`                         | Decode & validate JWT (already working) |
| Make it **required** for `/upload`, `/analysis`, `/videos` | Ensure user-specific data access        |

### 🔥 You’re Set Up for Full User-Specific Flow

Once we:

* Hook in user-specific video listing (`/videos`)
* Tie each uploaded file to a user (in a DB or by directory)
* Add Claude feedback mapping per-user

You’ve got a **real AI coaching SaaS**.

Let me know if you want help:

* Updating `/upload` backend route to include `Depends(get_current_user)`
* Persisting uploads per user
* Storing results + metadata in a DB

You're right on target. Keep going strong.
