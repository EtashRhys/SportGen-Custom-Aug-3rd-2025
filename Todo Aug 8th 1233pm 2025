🚀 Today’s Plan — Auth Finalization Sprint
Resend Verification Page (Frontend)

Create /resend-verification page with email input.

On submit → call backend resend endpoint.

Display success/failure alerts.

UX: Show link to this page on login/signup if account is unverified.

Password Reset Flow (Frontend)

Create /forgot-password page → sends reset email.

Create /reset-password page → user enters new password after clicking email link.

Wire both to backend endpoints already built.

Verification Flow UX Polish

If unverified → automatically redirect to “Verify Email” page with a big “Resend Email” button.

Make verification success page redirect to login automatically after ~3 seconds.

Regression Test the Full Auth Cycle

Sign up → verify email → log in → log out → log back in.

Try to log in without verification (should block + suggest resend).

Try password reset flow from start to finish.

Ensure JWT refresh works after login for at least an hour.

💡 Once we wrap those, the auth system will be airtight — which means the rest of SportGen can focus entirely on the fun stuff: uploads, AI analysis, and dashboard polish without tripping over auth bugs.
