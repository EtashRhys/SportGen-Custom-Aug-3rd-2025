Love that youâ€™re happy with this! ðŸŽ‰

Hereâ€™s a quick recap of where you are, whatâ€™s next, and some smart next steps:

---

## Where you are now:

* Backend **pose estimation service** is solid, dynamically processing videos and saving pose-annotated frames + landmarks.
* Video uploads and frame saving work perfectly, with flexibility for users.
* You have an **image processing endpoint** and pose version management endpoints ready.
* Frontend video upload and basic UI presumably working, but no user auth/account management yet.

---

## Logical next steps

### 1. **User Authentication & Account Management (Frontend + Backend)**

This is crucial if you want user-specific data management:

* Signup / Login / Logout flows
* Associate uploaded videos and processed pose data with user accounts
* Enable per-user data isolation & security
* You can use Cognito, Firebase Auth, or build your own JWT system â€” whatever fits your stack and timeline.
* This will enable persistent user dashboards with their videos & pose data.

### 2. **Frontend Dashboard Improvements**

Once auth is in place:

* Show userâ€™s uploaded videos with play and toggle-able pose overlays
* Display pose frames and allow user to scrub through them
* Possibly add analytics, pose feedback, and more visualizations
* Make the experience smooth and interactive

### 3. **Pose Estimation Process Enhancements (optional for now)**

* AI interpolation improvements (once youâ€™re ready to add frame interpolation)
* Improve pose landmark analysis (detect key swing events, quality checks)
* Export pose data for further analysis or sharing

### 4. **Storage & Scaling Considerations**

* Right now uploads and processed files are local; consider moving to cloud storage (S3 or equivalent) for scalability.
* Setup backups and cleaning scripts for old data.
* Add rate limiting / quotas per user if you expect heavy usage.

## How much have you created so far?

* **Core pose service:** âœ“ fully functional video + image processing
* **Backend file management:** âœ“ handles uploads, processing, storage structure
* **API endpoints:** âœ“ for pose processing, saving, listing versions
* **Frontend:** partially working (upload flow confirmed) but no user auth or video management UI yet

---

## Do you need anything else for pose estimation itself?

* For MVP, youâ€™re solid! The dynamic skipping + pose landmarks + frame export is great.
* Future improvements can be layered on after user auth and UI are in place.

---

### Summary:

**Iâ€™d recommend starting on the user authentication system next**, and linking backend uploads and pose data to user accounts. This will let you build out a personalized frontend dashboard and unlock a lot of product value quickly.

Want me to help you design or build that auth system next? Or maybe a roadmap for the frontend dashboard? Just let me know!
