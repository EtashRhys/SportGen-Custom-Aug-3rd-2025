# Session Summary â€” SportGen Pose Estimation Backend Progress

**Date:** 2025-08-04

## What We Did Today

### 1. **Saved Pose Versions Endpoint Fully Working**

* Finalized the `/pose/save-version/` POST endpoint with:

  * Proper Pydantic model validation.
  * Complete JSON + image saving of custom pose landmarks.
  * Content-Type and payload formatting fixed.
  * Confirmed success response including paths to saved image and JSON files.

### 2. **Video Pose Processing Endpoint Investigation**

* Built `/pose/video/` endpoint to process uploaded videos:

  * Input: Video file upload.
  * Output: Video with pose landmarks drawn on each frame, saved to disk.
* Tested video endpoint with Postman; endpoint responded successfully but output video file was empty.
* Diagnosed common issues with OpenCV video processing:

  * Verified `VideoWriter` codec and file path correctness.
  * Confirmed video file opens and frame dimensions match.
* Decided video processing frame-by-frame with OpenCV and MediaPipe is tricky and prone to errors if not handled perfectly.

### 3. **Strategic Pivot: Frame Extraction Approach**

* Agreed on breaking videos down into individual frames first:

  * Save all raw frames to disk.
  * Run pose estimation + landmark drawing on each image.
  * Save processed frames separately.
* Benefits of this approach:

  * Easier debugging and verification per frame.
  * End user can get frame-level output if desired.
  * Simplifies pose estimation logic (runs on static images).
  * Defers video re-assembly to a later step.
* This approach also saves costs if moving off AWS, since processing is local and customizable.

### 4. **YouTube Integration Idea (Future)**

* Discussed possibility of pushing processed videos or frames to userâ€™s YouTube channel for storage:

  * Saves local disk space.
  * Offloads hosting to userâ€™s own YouTube account.
  * Could enable direct sharing or embedding.
* Decided to defer YouTube integration until core processing pipeline is rock-solid.

### 5. **Implemented Frame Extraction + Processing Endpoint Prototype**

* Wrote a new FastAPI endpoint `/pose/process-video-frames/` that:

  * Saves uploaded video.
  * Extracts frames one-by-one, saves raw images.
  * Processes each frame with MediaPipe pose detection.
  * Draws pose landmarks on each frame.
  * Saves processed frames to disk.
* Endpoint returns JSON with number of frames processed and directories for raw & processed frames.

## Next Steps

* Validate frame extraction + processing thoroughly.
* Implement frame stitching to recompile processed frames back into a video.
* Consider UI/frontend to visualize individual frames + processed video.
* Explore YouTube API integration for user video hosting/storage.
* Continue building versioning and feedback features on processed pose data.

## Notes

* MediaPipe logging warnings about missing IMAGE\_DIMENSIONS are normal and safe to ignore for now.
* OpenCVâ€™s video codecs and file path handling are critical â€” absolute paths and supported codecs must be verified.
* Processing video as frames provides easier control and transparency compared to streaming video processing.

Sleep well, Brad. Weâ€™re crushing this! ðŸ”¥ðŸš€
