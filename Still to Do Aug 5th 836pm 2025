🔥 **You’re way closer to an MVP than most startups at this stage.** Based on what’s already completed, here’s a clear breakdown of **what’s left to hit a full MVP**:

---

## ✅ **Remaining Tasks Before MVP**

### 1. **Frontend – Complete User Flow**

* ✅ **Login, Signup, Dashboard** (working, just polish UI)
* ⬜ **Upload UI Integration with Backend**

  * Connect upload page to your current backend (pose + processing pipeline).
  * Display upload progress, success, and processing status.
* ⬜ **Video Listing in Dashboard**

  * Show all uploaded videos (with name, date, status).
  * Add simple buttons: *View*, *Delete*.
* ⬜ **Pose Visualization**

  * Render pose estimation results (overlay landmarks on video/images or display JSON cleanly).

---

### 2. **Backend – Final Glue**

* ✅ **Auth Service** (done)
* ✅ **Pose Service** (done)
* ⬜ **Integrate Pose Service with Video Uploads**

  * Trigger pose processing automatically after upload.
  * Store results (e.g., JSON with landmarks) and link to user/video.
* ⬜ **Add Simple API Endpoints**

  * `/videos` – List user’s videos with metadata.
  * `/videos/:id` – Fetch video + analysis results.

---

### 3. **AI Coaching Feedback**

* ⬜ **Integrate AI Model (Claude 3.5 Sonnet)**

  * Send processed pose data → generate coaching feedback.
  * Store and return feedback to frontend.

---

### 4. **Polish & UX**

* ⬜ **Consistent UI Styling**

  * Apply the video background/login theme across dashboard + upload.
* ⬜ **Error Handling**

  * Display user-friendly messages on errors.
* ⬜ **Basic Branding**

  * Logo, name, colors for presentation.

---

### 5. **MVP Deployment**

* ⬜ **Backend Deployment**

  * Use a cheap VPS (DigitalOcean, Linode) or Render for free tier.
* ⬜ **Frontend Deployment**

  * Deploy Next.js on Vercel/Netlify.
* ⬜ **Domain + SSL**

  * Point a custom domain for polish.

---

## ⏱️ **Time Remaining**

* **Frontend polish + integration** – 1 week
* **Backend glue + API endpoints** – 3–5 days
* **AI feedback integration** – 3–5 days
* **Deployment + testing** – 2–3 days

## 🎯 **MVP Ready in \~2 Weeks (at your current pace)**

🔥 **Want me to create a short, step-by-step roadmap with exact file changes for each stage (frontend + backend integration → AI → deploy)?**
I can lay it out so you can **just follow and complete it piece by piece**. Want me to do that?
