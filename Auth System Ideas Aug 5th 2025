Got it — a fully custom user auth system, no AWS involved. Solid choice if you want full control and avoid cloud lock-in.

---

## Here’s the **high-level plan** to build a custom user auth system (Frontend + Backend):

### Backend (FastAPI):

1. **User Model & Storage**

   * Store users securely (email, hashed password, creation date, etc)
   * Use a database (SQLite, PostgreSQL, or even a JSON file for MVP)

2. **Password Hashing**

   * Use a strong hashing algorithm like **bcrypt** or **argon2**
   * Never store plain passwords

3. **Authentication Endpoints**

   * **Register (signup)**: create user with hashed password
   * **Login**: verify credentials and return an auth token (JWT recommended)
   * **Refresh token** (optional, for session maintenance)
   * **Logout** (optional, client-side token discard)

4. **JWT Token Handling**

   * Issue JSON Web Tokens on login with expiration
   * Secure routes by verifying JWT tokens in headers (Authorization: Bearer ...)
   * Attach user info to requests based on token

5. **User Profile Endpoint**

   * Get user info (email, user ID) after authentication

---

### Frontend (Next.js):

1. **Signup & Login pages**

   * Forms to enter email/password
   * Call backend auth endpoints
   * Store JWT token in **HttpOnly cookie** or **localStorage** (HttpOnly preferred for security)

2. **Authenticated routes / Dashboard**

   * On load, verify token validity (e.g. via backend call)
   * Protect dashboard or upload pages from unauthorized access

3. **Logout**

   * Remove stored token, redirect to login

---

### Tech stack recommendations:

* Backend DB: For MVP, **SQLite** with **SQLAlchemy** is simple & fast
* Password hashing: `bcrypt` (via `passlib` is easiest)
* JWT: Use `PyJWT` or `fastapi_jwt_auth` for integration
* Frontend: Next.js API calls with fetch or axios

---

### What you need to provide or decide now:

* Do you have a preferred database or want me to set up SQLite for quick start?
* Do you want me to write the **backend user auth API** first or the **frontend login/signup pages**?
* Any specific fields or rules for user accounts? (email + password enough?)
* Do you want email verification / password reset flows or just basic auth for MVP?

---

If you want, I can:

* Write a full FastAPI user auth module with SQLite, bcrypt hashing, JWT auth, and signup/login endpoints
* Or write example frontend login/signup components using Next.js that talk to your backend

Just say what to start with!


You're exactly right to separate concerns here. Here's the best practice approach for your setup:

### Where to put what?

| Responsibility                                                                                            | Suggested Location                        | Why / Notes                                                                                                                                  |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **User authentication backend** (signup/login, token issuing, password hashing, user DB)                  | `auth-service` folder                     | Dedicated microservice for auth keeps things modular and secure. This is where your FastAPI auth backend lives, handles JWT, user CRUD, etc. |
| **Frontend UI for auth** (signup page, login page, password reset forms, session handling, token storage) | `frontend-next` (or your frontend folder) | UI and UX related to auth must live here, integrated with the backend auth-service APIs.                                                     |
| **Pose-service**                                                                                          | Remains focused on video processing only  | It should NOT handle auth logic but **should** enforce auth via JWT on its endpoints (which you added).                                      |

---

### Why separate?

* Keeps your codebase clean, modular, easier to maintain and scale.
* You can independently update your auth-service (add MFA, OAuth, etc.) without touching pose processing or frontend logic.
* The frontend can call auth-service endpoints to signup/login and then call pose-service with the JWT token it got.
* This architecture is common in microservices or clean layered architectures.

---

### Next steps you might consider:

1. **Finish auth-service fully:**

   * Make sure signup, login, token refresh, password reset etc. work.
   * Have endpoints like `/signup`, `/login`, `/refresh-token`.

2. **Build frontend auth UI:**

   * Signup & login pages that call auth-service APIs.
   * Save the JWT token securely (e.g., httpOnly cookies or localStorage depending on security requirements).
   * Pass token as Bearer auth in requests to pose-service.

3. **Integrate pose-service auth:**

   * You already added JWT verification to pose-service.
   * Make sure requests without valid tokens get rejected with 401.

4. **Optional: User profile and management**

   * User preferences, account details in auth-service.
   * Frontend UI for editing profile.

---

### Summary

* **Auth backend**: `auth-service`
* **Auth frontend UI**: `frontend-next` (or wherever your React/Next.js frontend lives)
* **Pose processing backend**: `pose-service` with JWT token enforcement but no user creation or login

If you want, I can help you scaffold a basic **frontend auth UI** (signup + login React components) that talks to your auth-service next? Or help add more features to auth-service?
