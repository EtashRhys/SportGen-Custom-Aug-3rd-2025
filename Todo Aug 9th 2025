Here’s exactly how we’ll attack this in Postman tomorrow so we get clarity on where your verification is failing and fix it fast.

---

## **1️⃣ Test the `/register` endpoint**

**Goal:** Make sure a new user can be created and the backend sends a proper verification email with a working token.

**Steps:**

1. In Postman:

   * Method: `POST`
   * URL: `http://localhost:5000/register`
   * Body → JSON:

     ```json
     {
       "email": "newtestuser@example.com",
       "password": "Test1234"
     }
     ```
2. Check the **response JSON** for:

   * A success message.
   * The verification email being "sent" (in dev, maybe printed to console or saved to logs).
   * The token link format (we’ll extract this token for the next test).

---

## **2️⃣ Test `/verify-email` directly**

**Goal:** See if verification works **without** the frontend.

**Steps:**

1. Take the token from the registration response or logs.
2. In Postman:

   * Method: `POST`
   * URL: `http://localhost:5000/verify-email`
   * Body → JSON:

     ```json
     {
       "token": "PASTE_TOKEN_HERE"
     }
     ```
3. Check:

   * Response should be `200 OK` and say **“Email verified successfully”**.
   * If you get an error, we’ll confirm if it’s token parsing, expiration, or DB lookup.

---

## **3️⃣ Test `/login` before and after verification**

**Goal:** Ensure login is blocked until verification is done.

**Steps:**

1. **Before verification:**

   * POST → `http://localhost:5000/login`
   * Body:

     ```json
     {
       "email": "newtestuser@example.com",
       "password": "Test1234"
     }
     ```
   * Expected: **401 Unauthorized** or **"Please verify your email first"**.
2. **After verification:**

   * Same request.
   * Expected: **200 OK** with a JWT token.

## **4️⃣ Test expired or invalid token behavior**

**Goal:** Make sure expired or tampered tokens fail.

**Steps:**

1. Take a real token and edit 1–2 characters.
2. Send to `/verify-email`.
3. Expected: **400 or 401** with **"Invalid or expired token"**.
4. If possible, generate an expired token and confirm it fails.

---

## **5️⃣ Test frontend integration after backend is confirmed**

**Goal:** Make sure `/verify` page in `verify.tsx` works with the real API.

**Steps:**

1. Register in frontend.
2. Copy the verification link from the email/logs.
3. Paste it in browser.
4. Expected: ✅ Success page → redirect to login → login works.

### **Why this plan works**

We’re isolating the problem:

* If Postman works → the backend is fine, issue is frontend fetch.
* If Postman fails → backend token handling is the issue.

I can also **write a Postman Collection** tonight so tomorrow we can just import it and run all tests in one click. That’ll save time.

Do you want me to prep that collection for you?
