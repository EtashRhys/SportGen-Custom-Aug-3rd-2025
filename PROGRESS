🔥 **SPORTGEN-AI – PROGRESS LOG (Today’s Achievements)**

Here’s your **complete rundown** of what we accomplished today so you can document it for GitHub:

---

## ✅ **1. Backend & Frontend Setup Cleaned & Structured**

* **Node.js Backend** is fully operational with:

  * `server.js` for server entrypoint
  * Routes:

    * `/api/videos` → handles uploads
    * `/api/analysis` → sends videos for analysis
    * `/api/auth` → (stubbed for now)
  * `services/poseService.js` → calls FastAPI pose service
  * `uploads/` → clean, centralized folder for storing uploaded videos

* **Frontend (Next.js)**:

  * `lib/api.ts` contains reusable API functions (`uploadVideo`, `analyzeVideo`)
  * Upload page (`upload.tsx`) now correctly uploads videos and triggers analysis

---

## ✅ **2. Video Upload Working (End-to-End)**

* Implemented `multer` in backend to handle video uploads.
* Fixed the bug where **uploads were saving to `backend/backend/uploads`** by correcting paths.
* Postman and frontend both confirmed working file uploads.
* Video files saved with unique timestamps in `backend/uploads/`.
* Tested with multiple files (`brad2013.mp4`, `LeBronJamesGolfSwing.mp4`) → ✅ success.

---

## ✅ **3. FastAPI Pose Service Integrated**

* Created **pose-service** (FastAPI app) running independently on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
* Added `CORS` support so Node backend can call it.
* Designed `/analyze-pose/` endpoint to receive video path JSON.
* Fixed `422 Unprocessable Entity` by:

  * Changing request format to JSON instead of file upload.
  * Matching backend’s `video_path` field.
* FastAPI now responds with `200 OK` and mock keypoints data.

---

## ✅ **4. Backend → FastAPI → Backend Flow Operational**

* Node backend’s `/api/analysis` successfully calls `runPoseEstimation()` which:

  * Sends video path to FastAPI service
  * Receives mock pose estimation response
  * Returns AI feedback (currently mock) + pose data back to frontend
* Logs confirm:

  * ✅ Upload works
  * ✅ Analysis triggers
  * ✅ Pose service returns successfully

---

## ✅ **5. Full System E2E Test Successful**

* **Workflow now works completely:**

  * Frontend uploads → Node saves → Node calls FastAPI → FastAPI responds → Node returns analysis → Frontend ready to display results.
* You now have **zero dependency on AWS**, and full local control.
* The codebase is **clean, modular, and ready for real AI logic**.

---

## ✅ **6. Next Steps**

1. **Add real pose estimation** in `app.py` using MediaPipe/OpenPose.
2. Pass extracted keypoints back to Node.
3. Integrate `anthropicService.js` to send keypoints to Claude for smart feedback.
4. Update frontend to **display pose analysis + AI feedback**.

---

## 🚀 **Conclusion**

You have:
✔️ A working **upload & storage system**
✔️ A working **backend API**
✔️ A working **FastAPI microservice**
✔️ Successful **Node → FastAPI integration**
✔️ The foundation for **Claude AI + Pose Analysis MVP**
