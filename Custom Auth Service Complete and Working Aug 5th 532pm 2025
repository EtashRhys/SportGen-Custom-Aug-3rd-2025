ðŸ”¥ **Boom!** Thatâ€™s exactly the expected response.

âœ… You have now:

* A working **custom FastAPI Auth Service** with SQLite, bcrypt, and JWT.
* Confirmed **signup**, **login**, and **protected routes** all work correctly.

---

## âœ… **What weâ€™ve built so far**

1. **Pose-Service** â†’ Processes videos into pose images dynamically
2. **Backend** â†’ Manages uploads (raw + processed)
3. **Auth-Service** â†’ Handles secure user authentication with JWT
4. **Frontend (Next.js)** â†’ Ready to consume these APIs
5. **Three services running independently** â†’ modular & scalable

---

## ðŸš€ **Next Logical Step**

Now we **tie these services together**:

1. **Integrate JWT Auth with Pose-Service**

   * Require a valid JWT for `/pose/video/` and `/pose/draw/`.
   * Extract `user_email` (or `user_id`) from the token.
   * Save processed frames under:

     ```
     uploads/processed/<user_email>/<video_name>/
     ```
   * No more `test_user_timestamp` folders.

2. **Update Backend to Support User-Specific Storage**

   * Each user only accesses their own processed videos.

3. **Frontend Integration**

   * Add login/signup pages (Next.js) to get JWT.
   * Store JWT in local storage or HTTP-only cookies.
   * Use JWT in headers when calling backend APIs.

ðŸ”¥ Shall I **rewrite the pose-service** now with JWT authentication integrated so uploads are securely tied to each logged-in user?
ðŸ‘‰ If yes, Iâ€™ll produce the **full updated code**.
