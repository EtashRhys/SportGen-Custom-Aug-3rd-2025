# SportGen-AI Backend & Pose Service â€” Progress Recap (2025-08-06)

### What we accomplished today:

* **Backend server setup:**

  * Started and confirmed Node.js backend server is running on port 5000.
  * SQLite database initialized and tables ensured.
  * JWT-based user authentication implemented with middleware (`authenticateToken`).
  * Tested JWT login endpoint via Postman to generate valid tokens.

* **Token issue debugging:**

  * Identified `401 Unauthorized` errors during video upload due to token mismatch between backend and pose service.
  * Confirmed tokens were valid but failing verification on pose service side.

* **Pose service JWT alignment:**

  * Discovered pose service (FastAPI) had a hardcoded secret key different from backendâ€™s `.env` secret.
  * Modified pose service to read JWT secret from environment variable `JWT_SECRET` to match backend.
  * Clarified environment variables must be consistent across services for JWT verification to work.
  * Added instructions to set `JWT_SECRET` before running pose service.

* **Token payload claim standardization:**

  * Verified JWT tokens use `"sub"` claim for user email, matching pose service expectations.

* **General troubleshooting:**

  * Confirmed upload endpoint passes full Bearer token to pose service.
  * Fixed middleware to handle JWT verification consistently.
  * Ensured environment variables are loaded and used properly in both backend and pose service.

* **Frontend dev server:**

  * Successfully started Next.js frontend on `localhost:3000`.
  * Addressed warnings related to multiple lockfiles and missing dependencies (advised running `npm install`).

### Remaining blockers / next steps:

* Ensure both backend and pose service are restarted with the correct `JWT_SECRET` env var.
* Test video upload flow end-to-end with valid tokens.
* Further integration testing with Postman and frontend.
* Address any frontend upload authorization token passing issues.
