Absolutely! Here's a clear breakdown of **what we just built** and where everything lives:

---

### 1. **Backend (`backend/` folder)**

This is where your main FastAPI server runs, handling:

* **Uploads** — raw user images get saved here.
* **Pose Estimation** — running MediaPipe on the uploaded images to detect human pose landmarks.
* **Image Processing** — drawing pose landmarks on the images.
* **Versioning** — saving different versions of pose landmark edits with associated images and JSON data.
* **Listing Versions** — allowing retrieval of saved versions per uploaded image.

**Key files and folders:**

* `app.py`
  The FastAPI app that:

  * Accepts image uploads and runs pose detection.
  * Saves processed images with landmarks drawn.
  * Saves multiple versions of landmarks + images.
  * Lists all saved versions for a given image.

* `uploads/` (folder)
  Centralized folder to hold **all image files and versions**:

  * `uploads/<original images>` (raw user uploads)
  * `uploads/processed/` (processed images with initial pose landmarks drawn)
  * `uploads/versions/<image_basename>/` (version folders containing edited pose images and JSON)

---

### 2. **Pose-Service (the Python virtual environment & FastAPI running environment)**

* You run the backend (`app.py`) inside this environment with `uvicorn app:app --reload`.
* This folder contains your virtual environment (`venv`) where all Python dependencies like FastAPI, MediaPipe, OpenCV, etc., are installed.
* The pose estimation logic and image processing happen here.

---

### What you have now:

* **Clean folder structure**: All user data is inside one main `uploads/` folder with subfolders for organization.
* **Endpoints:**

  * `/pose/draw/` — Upload an image, get pose landmarks + processed image with pose points drawn.
  * `/pose/save-version/` — Save an edited version of pose landmarks as a new image + JSON.
  * `/pose/list-versions/{basename}` — List all saved versions for a particular uploaded image.

### Summary

| Component              | Purpose                                  | Location/Folder              |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| FastAPI backend server | Pose detection, version save & list APIs | `backend/app.py`             |
| Uploaded images        | Raw user-uploaded photos                 | `backend/uploads/`           |
| Processed images       | Initial pose landmarks drawn images      | `backend/uploads/processed/` |
| Versioned edits        | Edited pose images & landmark JSON data  | `backend/uploads/versions/`  |
| Virtual env & packages | Python env with dependencies             | `pose-service/venv/`         |

If you want, I can help you design how the **frontend** can leverage this backend structure for uploading images, showing pose points, editing, and saving versions — just say the word!
